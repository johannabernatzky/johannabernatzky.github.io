                    <p>Write about a secret you or a character have been keeping.</p>
<p>Charlie was still giggling when she unlocked the front door. Jess had been so funny, imitating Mr Hobbs, their maths teacher. “How many times do I have to tell you, right angles are per-pen-dicular!” She had a way of getting it just right, the way he spat out his p’s, like he wanted to slingshot them straight into your brain. “Repeat after me Charlie, pa-per, pers-piration, per-plexed, pep-per…”
Pur-ple pa-prika Charlie thought as she walked down the corridor, that’s a good one. Pep-peroni pizza. “How was your day honey?”, her mother shouted from the kitchen, “still hungry?” “I ate at Jess’,” Charlie replied, already halfway up the stairs. Going into the kitchen at this hour was dangerous. She loved her parents in the morning, she really did. But in the evening, they were a complete disaster. All they wanted to do was talk. It would start with “anything interesting happen at school today?” and wouldn’t end before they hadn’t extracted from her every minute detail of her day. She supposed old people needed the entertainment. Her parents both worked at the city library. They woke up together, had breakfast (her father made the tea, her mother the porridge), went to work together and walked home together. Sometimes it seemed to her like over all their years together, always together, they had forgotten how to talk to each other.<br>
Tonight, Charlie didn’t feel like stepping in for their entertainment. She didn’t want her day dissected until it didn’t feel whole anymore. It had been too precious. And she was worried. Worried that her parents would notice something in the way she spoke about Jess. Worried that they could see the butterflies tickling her insides whenever she thought about her. She so desperately wanted to keep them secret, keep them safe. In Biology they had learned that butterfly wings were so fragile that one touch, one raindrop might be enough to break them. So she knew she couldn’t let them out, couldn’t let her parents see. 
She closed her door tightly behind her. On her desk sat a plate of cookies, steaming still from the oven. Sometimes her parents weren’t too bad she supposed. Her pocket pinged. 
Jess: What are you up to?
Charlie: Just thinking about butterflies. You?
Jess: Haha really? You know I used to collect butterflies, seems sadistic in hindsight though.
Charlie: You preposterous person…Mr Hobbs is disappointed in you.
Jess: I know, I’ll personally apologise to him tomorrow.
Charlie took a bite of her cookie and felt a warmth spreading throughout her. It really was sadistic she thought to herself, keeping butterflies locked up. One day she would let them out.</p>
