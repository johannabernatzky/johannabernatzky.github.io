      <description>Write about a painting you find online or on your walls.
   English 中文     This morning I woke up feeling fluffy inside and out. The soft pillow against my cheek, the aftereffects of a generous helping of vino. My nose was the first thing to spring into action. The faint smell of coffee drifting in from somewhere carried promise. I sat up in bed, slowly to not upset the cotton filling my head.</description>

      <description>Go outside. Put on your writer hat. Try to notice 5 things to write about! What I saw: a family having a barbecue, a butterfly pacing me on my run, a front yard full of purple hyacinths and yellow primroses, a tree hung with Easter eggs, and an adventurous cat.
我看到了：在烧烤的一家人，和我一起慢跑的蝴蝶，布满紫色风信子和鹅黄色樱草的前院，挂上复活节彩蛋的树 ，以及一只爱冒险的小猫咪。
   English 中文     The breeze tickles my whiskers and I am awake. First things first, I give my body a delicious stretch.</description>

      <description>Write about a secret you or a character have been keeping.
   English 中文     Charlie was still giggling when she unlocked the front door. Jess had been so funny, imitating Mr Hobbs, their maths teacher. “How many times do I have to tell you, right angles are per-pen-dicular!” She had a way of getting it just right, the way he spat out his p’s, like he wanted to slingshot them straight into your brain.</description>

      <description>Set your text to white and try freewriting in invisible mode.
   English 中文     Where am I? Everything is bright, I have forgotten my past, I don’t know my future. All I have is now, an existence barely there. I am flickering in and out of consciousness. I feel something. A rhythm is driving me forwards. In and out and in and out. What am I running towards?</description>

      <description>Pick 5 words at random from different blog posts, tweets, or articles and use them all in a scene. Social distance, tourist attraction, currywurst, cherry blossoms, virtual kiss. 个人空间、景点、咖喱香肠、樱花、隔空亲吻.
   English 中文     Deep in the mountains, hidden behind a gurgling waterfall, lies a secret land. Only the rarest souls find its entrance. Hikers marvel at the refreshing mist, check a tourist attraction off their list, send their loved ones photographic evidence.</description>

      <title>Day 1: But Why Can&#39;t I Go Out?</title>

      <description>Write about a character who&amp;rsquo;s stuck inside. How do they feel about it? Why are they there?
   English 中文     “But why can’t I go out mum?” asked the little meerkat. It was barely a few weeks old, silver fluff still covered its fur like cobwebs. A meerkat’s favourite place to be is in the scorching sun. Coming out from the dark tunnels with their twists and turns, the eyes take a while to adjust.</description>
