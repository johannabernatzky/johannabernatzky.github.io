      <description>Set your text to white and try freewriting in invisible mode
   English 中文     Where am I? Everything is bright, I have forgotten my past, I don’t know my future. All I have is now, an existence barely there. I am flickering in and out of consciousness.

      <description>Pick 5 words at random from different blog posts, tweets, or articles and use them all in a scene. Social distance, tourist attraction, currywurst, cherry blossoms, virtual kiss. 个人空间、景点、咖喱香肠、樱花、隔空亲吻.
   English 中文     Deep in the mountains, hidden behind a gurgling waterfall, lies a secret land. Only the rarest souls find its entrance. Hikers marvel at the refreshing mist, check a tourist attraction off their list, send their loved ones photographic evidence.</description>

      <description>Write about a character who&#39;s stuck inside. How do they feel about it? Why are they there?
   English 中文     “But why can’t I go out mum?” asked the little meerkat. It was barely a few weeks old, silver fluff still covered its fur like cobwebs. A meerkat’s favourite place to be is in the scorching sun. Coming out from the dark tunnels with their twists and turns, the eyes take a while to adjust.</description>
